# OpenGL-EforEdimar
## A program that displays the letter E on a window using GLFW, GLAD and OpenGL.

### OpenGL, GLFW and GLAD
OpenGL is mainly considered an API (an Application Programming Interface) that provides us with a large set of functions that we can use to manipulate graphics and images.

GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop. It provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.

GLAD is a loader that loads pointers to OpenGL functions at runtime. The pointers to these functions change from OS to OS, so that's why it's needed.

### Description
This project displays the project E by using OpenGL to send vertex data to the computer's GPU and enabling shader programs to set up a basic graphics pipeline. Then by using GLFW, we're able to render the data unto the window.
